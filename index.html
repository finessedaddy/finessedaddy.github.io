  <h1> Introduction:
    Hi my name is brandon. I like fishing, cooking, and gardening. My academic interests are hands on practical science, and marine biology </h1>
  <h3> I am an 11th grade student here at the Ross School in East Hampton N.Y. I have done many science related projects involving fish, plants, and research  </h3>I have been at ross for three years
  Some new projects i am thinking abut for this year are painting and customizing my own aluminum fishing reel, making my own fishing lures, and moving my tilapia to a larger plexi class tank that is sitting in the lab. To do that, I have to refurbish the tank first, though.
