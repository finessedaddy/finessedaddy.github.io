   My academic Interests are hands on practical science, human anatomy, and marine biology. Some hobbies I enjoy are fishing, cooking, fly-tying, kayaking, working out, and gardening.
    I am an 11th grade student here at the Ross School in East Hampton N.Y. I have done many science related projects involving fish, plants, and research. I have been at Ross for three years</p>
    <p>
  This year I am currently working on a fly-tying project, where I am learning the basics of tying different types of flies, and then learning about the insects and their life cycles that each of the flies imitates. My goal is to have an interconnected project where art meets science. I am learning about local insect species and the types of fish that feed on each insect, then discovering new and innovative methods and materials to use to replicate these insects. For example, I am making a synthetic foam dubbing that keeps dry flies floating forever, unlike most dubbings on the market today. This simple, yet incredibly effective idea helps the fishermen's presentation to look more relistic. Another creation I made was a thin, long profile bucktail to match its silhouette to that of a sandeel or young american eel. Most bucktails are made of a stiff, deer hair material without much action that is very wide, therefore creating wide bodies. The sandeel, a favorite forage item of the striped bass: one of the East coasts most popular sportfish, is a long, thin-bodied fish. In order to make sandeel imitation teasers and bucktails more accurate, I am tying my them with single turkey marabou blood quills. This is a commonly used material in freshwater jigs, but for some reason never made much of an appearance on the saltwater scene. The blood quill makes long, thin tails that flutter and pulsate with the slightest current change or movement.</p>

For my modernity project I am building a scaled model of the first electronically operated washing machine. The "Thor" washing machine, created by Alva J. Fisher of the Hurley Appliance company in Chicago was a milestone for housewives. It was the first washing machine to make use of a Westinghouse motor with a clutch, which reversed direction every 8 rotations. This mechanized the most tiresome of a housewive's chores, and helped catalize feminism and improve the overall national standard of hygeine and cleanliness. </p>
